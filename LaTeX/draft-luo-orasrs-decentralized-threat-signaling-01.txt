    Decentralized Threat Signaling Protocol (DTSP) using OraSRS
                 draft-luo-orasrs-decentralized-threat-signaling-01


   abstract

   This document specifies the Decentralized Threat Signaling Protocol
   (DTSP), a mechanism for distributed edge clients to collaboratively
   detect, report, and mitigate network threats. The protocol defines a
   state machine for threat lifecycle management (T0-T3), a standardized
   data format for threat signaling, and security mechanisms to prevent
   abuse in a permissionless environment.




0. Introduction


   The increasing sophistication of network attacks requires a
   collaborative defense mechanism that operates at the edge.
   Centralized systems introduce unacceptable latency and single points
   of failure. DTSP shifts the paradigm from 'Filter then Verify' to
   'Verify then Filter', enabling < 1ms response times at the edge while
   maintaining global consensus integrity.

   DTSP enables a decentralized network of edge clients to share threat
   intelligence in real-time, leveraging a blockchain-based consensus
   mechanism for verification.

   See Figure 1 (Architecture Diagram) for the interaction between
   Kernel Space, User Space, and the Consensus Layer.

1. Terminology


   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 {{RFC2119}} {{!RFC8174}} when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.


2. Protocol Logic


   The lifecycle of a threat in DTSP is modeled as a Finite State
   Machine (FSM). Each edge client maintains the state of detected
   threats.


2.1. State Machine


   The FSM consists of the following states:

   o  **IDLE**: No threat detected.
   o  **OPTIMISTIC_BLOCK (T0)**: Local detection of suspicious activity. Immediate local mitigation.
   o  **REPORTED (T1)**: Threat evidence submitted to the network.
   o  **VERIFIED (T2)**: Network consensus reached. Threat confirmed.
   o  **GLOBAL_ENFORCE (T3)**: Global propagation of the threat signature.
   o  **EXPIRED**: Threat entry validity period ended.


2.1. State Transitions



2.1.1. T0: Local Detection


   The Edge Client MUST transition to the `OPTIMISTIC_BLOCK` state
   immediately upon detection of traffic matching local heuristic rules
   (e.g., high-frequency connection attempts).

   In this state, the client:
   1.  MUST block the source IP locally.
   2.  SHOULD generate a `ThreatEvidence` package.

   #### Outbound C2 Interception

   In addition to inbound defense, the Edge Client MUST inspect outbound
   traffic for patterns matching known C2 (Command & Control)
   signatures.

   - **Pre-Release Query**: Outbound connections to suspicious
   domains/IPs trigger a synchronous lookup in the Local Cache.
   - **T0 Block**: If a match is found, the connection is terminated
   immediately at the kernel level to prevent data exfiltration.

   This mechanism protects against private key exfiltration from
   compromised nodes and botnet command reception. Implementation MUST
   use kernel-space filtering (e.g., Netfilter/eBPF) to achieve
   sub-millisecond interception latency.


2.1.1. T1: Signaling


   The Edge Client MUST transition to the `REPORTED` state after
   generating valid evidence. The client sends a `ThreatSignal` message
   to the network.

   To prevent front-running, the client MUST use a Commit-Reveal scheme:
   1.  **Commit**: Send `Hash(Evidence + Salt)`.
   2.  **Reveal**: Send `Evidence + Salt` after a random delay.


2.1.1. T2: Verification


   The state transitions to `VERIFIED` when the network (via Smart
   Contract or Oracle) validates the evidence.
   A threat is considered verified if:
   `Sum(Reputation(Reporters)) > Threshold`


2.1.1. T3: Global Enforcement


   Upon entering the `GLOBAL_ENFORCE` state, the threat signature is
   added to the Global Blocklist.
   All participating clients MUST synchronize this list and enforce
   blocking rules via their local kernel datapath (e.g., eBPF).


9. Data Format



9.1. Threat Signal


   The `ThreatSignal` message is used to report a detected threat. It is
   serialized using JSON.

   Field            Type        Description
   ---------------- ----------- --------------------------------------------------
   `version`        uint8       Protocol version (e.g., 1)
   `type`           uint8       Threat type (0=DDoS, 1=Scanning, 2=Malware)
   `source_ip`      bytes       IP address of the attacker (4 or 16 bytes for IPv4/IPv6)
   `target_ip`      bytes       IP address of the victim (4 or 16 bytes for IPv4/IPv6, optional)
   `timestamp`      uint64      Unix timestamp of detection (ms)
   `evidence`       bytes       Cryptographic proof or log snippet
   `signature`      bytes       Digital signature of the reporting client


9.1. Evidence Package


   Field            Type        Description
   ---------------- ----------- --------------------------------------------------
   `packet_dump`    bytes       Sample of malicious packets (pcap format)
   `flow_stats`     struct      Flow statistics (PPS, BPS, duration)
   `heuristics`     string      ID of the heuristic rule triggered


12. Operational Considerations



12.1. Resource Constraints & Performance


   The protocol is designed for resource-constrained edge environments
   (e.g., 512MB RAM). Implementation validation (v3.3.6) has
   demonstrated:

   - **Latency**: The T0 local heuristic limiter (eBPF) achieves a query
   latency of 0.001ms (40x better than the 0.04ms target).
   - **Throughput**: Capable of mitigating 40M PPS (SYN-Flood) on
   standard edge hardware while maintaining 100% availability of
   management channels (SSH).
   - **Footprint**: The complete agent operates within < 50MB (Hybrid
   Mode) or < 5MB (Native Mode) of memory.

   Implementers MUST prioritize kernel-space offloading (e.g.,
   Netfilter/eBPF) to meet these latency requirements.


12.1. Deployment Modes


   DTSP supports three deployment modes:

   1. **T0-Only (Standalone)**: Edge client operates independently without blockchain connectivity. Suitable for air-gapped environments or maximum stability requirements.
   2. **T0+T2 (Hybrid)**: Edge client with optional blockchain queries for enhanced threat intelligence. Recommended for most deployments.
   3. **T0+T2+T3 (Full)**: Complete decentralized consensus with threat reporting capabilities.

   Default configuration SHOULD disable T2/T3 modules to ensure maximum
   stability on resource-constrained devices.


12.1. Performance Validation


   Reference implementation testing (2025-12-19):
   - **Test Environment**: Linux 5.14.0, 4 CPU cores, 4.1Gi RAM.
   - **API Latency**: 19-24ms (P95 < 50ms).
   - **eBPF Query**: 0.001ms average.
   - **Stress Test**: 38,766 requests, 0 failures (100% success rate).
   - **Memory Usage**: 25.45 MB for 1516 threat entries.


16. Security Considerations



16.1. Sybil Attack Defense


   To prevent Sybil attacks where an adversary creates multiple
   identities to flood the network with false reports, DTSP utilizes a
   Reputation System.

   o  Each client MUST stake tokens to participate in reporting.
   o  The weight of a report is proportional to the client's `ReputationScore`.
   o  `ReputationScore` increases with valid reports and decreases with false positives.


16.1. Commit-Reveal Mechanism


   To prevent "free-riding" (copying others' reports) or front-running:

   1.  Clients MUST NOT broadcast raw evidence immediately.
   2.  Clients MUST broadcast `Commit = Hash(Evidence   Nonce)`.
   3.  After `T_reveal` blocks, clients MUST broadcast `Reveal = (Evidence, Nonce)`.
   4.  The network verifies `Hash(Reveal) == Commit`.


19. IANA Considerations
