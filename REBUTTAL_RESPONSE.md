We thank Reviewer #2 for the insightful comment on recidivism attacks. In our design, historical risk scores are permanently stored on-chain in the ThreatEvidence contract through the `submitThreatReport` and `getThreatReport` functions, enabling accelerated re-blocking upon recidivism. The blockchain-based evidence storage ensures that previously identified malicious entities cannot easily evade detection by changing their IP addresses or creating new identities, as their historical behavior patterns remain permanently recorded and verifiable. This creates a persistent and immutable threat reputation system that significantly increases the cost and decreases the potential success of recidivism attacks.

The economic model further reinforces this by implementing a reputation-based staking system where validators with a history of accurate reporting gain higher influence and rewards, while those engaging in malicious behavior face significant financial penalties through our slashing mechanism.
