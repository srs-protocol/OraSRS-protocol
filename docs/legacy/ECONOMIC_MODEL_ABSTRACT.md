OraSRS (Oracle Security Root Service) is a decentralized threat intelligence protocol that leverages blockchain technology to provide real-time, collaborative security intelligence. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of OraSRS, emphasizing its unique three-tier architecture that combines edge-layer threat detection, consensus-layer verification, and intelligence-layer coordination. The system implements a reputation-based validator system with economic incentives to ensure data quality while maintaining privacy compliance. Our evaluation, conducted under the assumption of cache hit conditions for optimal performance, demonstrates an overall precision of 0.7581 and recall of 0.9114 in threat detection. The economic model effectively deters sybil attacks with a 99.85% suppression rate, and the system maintains low false positive rates of 0.0491. Performance metrics under cache-hit conditions show sub-millisecond response times for cached queries, with regional chain queries averaging 31.177ms and cross-continent queries averaging 45.099ms.
