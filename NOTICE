ORIGINAL INNOVATIONS AND MECHANISMS
================================================================================

The following core mechanisms and architectural designs were originally 
conceived, designed, and implemented by Luo ZiQian in 2025:

1. **Risk Control First (先风控后查询) Mechanism**
   - Pioneering approach that performs risk assessment BEFORE allowing access
   - Inverts traditional "detect-then-block" paradigm to "assess-then-allow"
   - Enables proactive defense against zero-day threats based on IP reputation
   - First implementation: 2025-12-14

2. **Dynamic Ban Duration Stacking (动态封禁叠加)**
   - Adaptive ban duration calculation based on threat severity
   - Automatic duration extension for repeat offenders (local cache hits)
   - Maximum duration selection for globally confirmed threats (blockchain hits)
   - Temporal threat intelligence decay mechanism
   - First implementation: 2025-12-14

3. **Local-Blockchain Collaborative Decision Making (本地-链上协同决策)**
   - Hybrid architecture combining local cache with blockchain consensus
   - Multi-tier query strategy: whitelist → local cache → blockchain → new threat
   - Asynchronous blockchain reporting to maintain low latency
   - Distributed threat intelligence with local autonomy
   - First implementation: 2025-12-14

4. **High-Value Asset Protection (HVAP) Framework**
   - Three-tier defense mechanism (L1/L2/L3) based on risk scoring
   - PAM integration for SSH/system-level protection
   - Emergency whitelist mechanism for false positive mitigation
   - Zero-day protection through reputation-based access control
   - First implementation: 2025-12-14

5. **IoT Shield (物联网护盾) - Transparent Cleaning Layer**
   - "Query-before-allow" gateway architecture for IoT devices
   - Nginx auth_request integration for firmware-agnostic protection
   - Reputation-based service hiding (stealth defense)
   - Collective intelligence for resource-constrained devices
   - First implementation: 2025-12-14

6. **Advisory Service Model (咨询式服务模型)**
   - Non-blocking risk assessment paradigm
   - Client-autonomous decision making
   - Transparent evidence-based recommendations
   - Legal liability separation between assessment and enforcement

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
================================================================================

The OraSRS protocol embodies a fundamental shift in cybersecurity architecture:

- **From Signature to Reputation**: Moving beyond pattern matching to global 
  IP reputation scoring, enabling defense against unknown threats.

- **From Passive to Stealth**: Transforming exposed services into hidden 
  endpoints where high-risk IPs cannot even detect service existence.

- **From Terminal to Collective**: Empowering resource-constrained devices 
  with global threat intelligence through gateway-based protection.

These innovations solve critical problems in modern cybersecurity:
- Zero-day vulnerability exploitation
- IoT device protection without firmware modification
- False positive mitigation in automated defense systems
- Scalable threat intelligence sharing across heterogeneous networks
